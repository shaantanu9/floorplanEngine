hello and welcome to this new video in this video we're gonna cover 430 question answers for clfc02 AWS certified Cloud practitioner exam so before going to the question answers I request you to kindly subscribe to our YouTube channel if you're not already a subscriber and these question answers PDF is available to download from shapingpixel.com website or else you can request via email if you are a channel member on follower pack 2. so let&#39;s jump on to the questions so while going through the question answers if you think any of the answer is incorrect please let us know in the comment section with the question number and the right answer and your expiration please so let&#39;s jump on to the questions question number one who is responsible for configuring management under the AWS shared responsibility model and we have four options option A it is still only the responsibility of the customer option b it is certainly the responsibility of AWS option C it is shared between AWS and the customer option D it is not part of the AWS shared responsibility model so the right answer is option C it is shared between AWS and the customer AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems databases and applications question number two which compute hosting model should be accounted for in the total cost of ownership TCO when undertaking a cost analysis that allows physical isolation of a customer workload and the options are option a dedicated host option b reserved instances option C on demand instances option D no front reserved instances and the right answer is a dedicated host use dedicated host to launch Amazon ec2 instances on physical servers that are dedicated for your use dedicated host gives you additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server and you can reliably use the same physical server over time as a result dedicated host enable you to use your existing server bound software licenses like Windows server and address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements question number three who is accountable for security and compellence under the AWS shared responsibility model and the options are option A the customer is responsible option b AWS is responsible option C AWS and the customer share responsibility option D AWS shares responsibility with the relevant governing body the right answer is option C AWS and the customer share responsibility security and compellians is shared responsibility between AWS and the customer the shared model can help relieve the customer&#39;s operational burden as AWS operates manages and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the services operates question number four which of the following is a critical design concept for architecting cloud applications and you have four options option A use the largest instance possible option b provision capacity for Peak load option C use the scrum development process option D Implement elasticity the right answer is option D Implement elasticity cloud services main proposition is to provide elasticity through horizontal scaling it&#39;s already there as for using largest instance possible it is not a design principle that helps Cloud application in any way scrum development process is not related to architecting therefore a key principle is to provision your application for on-demand capacity Peak loads is something that cloud applications experience every day Peak load management should be a necessary part of cloud application design principle question number five who is the main

necessary and option d attach policies directly to each user individually so the right answer is option C start with the minimum set of permissions and Grant additional permissions as necessary so granting least privilege so when you create IEM policy the follow the Standard Security advice of granting least privilege or granting only the permissions required to perform a task determine that users need to do and then craft policies that allow them to perform only those tasks so start with the minimum set of permissions and Grant additional permissions as necessary doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later so question number 335 how can a Consolidated billing benefit a business with many AWS accounts and you have four options it Aggregates usage across accounts so that the company can reach volume discount threshold sooner and option b it offers an additional five percent discount and purchase of all upfront reserved instances and option C it provides a simplified billing invoice that the company can process more quickly than a standard invoice or option D it gives AWS resellers the ability to build their customers for usage the right answer is option A it Aggregates usage across accounts so that the company can reach volume discount threshold sooner so using Consolidated billing you can combine usage from multiple accounts into a single invoice allowing you to reach the tires with lower prices faster so you can also apply unused reservations from one account to another accounts instant usage so question number 336 AWS pay as you go pricing model and you have four options reduce capital expenditure requires payment Upfront for AWS services and option C is relevant only for Amazon ec2 Amazon S3 and Amazon RTS and option D reduces operational expenditure so the right answer is reduces capital expenditure option A so AWS helps you reduce total cost of ownership to reduce the need to invest
